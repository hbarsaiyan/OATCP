Approach
The problem of finding the largest number that can be formed by concatenating a given array of integers can be efficiently solved using a custom comparison function and sorting.

Steps
Define Comparison Function:

Define a custom comparison function compare that takes two integers and returns true if their concatenation results in a larger number when the first integer is placed before the second integer, otherwise false.
Sort Array:

Sort the array of integers using the custom comparison function. This ensures that the integers are arranged in a way that forms the largest number when concatenated.
Concatenate Integers:

Concatenate the sorted integers to form the result string.
Check Leading Zero:

Check if the first character of the result string is '0':
If it is '0', return "0" (since the largest number cannot start with '0').
Otherwise, return the result string.
