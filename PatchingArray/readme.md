- Input and Initialization: The program begins by opening input and output files using freopen(). It reads a sequence of integers from the input file (input1.txt) and stores them in a vector v. The loop continues until it encounters a newline character, indicating the end of the input sequence.

- Additional Input: After reading the sequence of integers, the program reads a single integer n from the input file. This integer represents the target value.

- Algorithm Execution:

  - The algorithm initializes two variables: miss to keep track of the current value that can't be reached, and ans to count the number of increments required to reach the target value n.
  - It iterates in a while loop until miss exceeds or equals n. Within the loop:
  - If there are remaining elements in vector v (i < v.size()) and the current element v[i] is less than or equal to miss, it means that the next element in the vector can be added to miss. Thus, it adds v[i] to miss and increments i.
  - If the above condition doesn't hold, it means that the elements in the vector v are exhausted or the current element is greater than miss. In such a case, it doubles the value of miss (as it is the minimum value that cannot be reached) and increments ans to count this doubling operation.
  - The loop continues until miss exceeds or equals n, indicating that the target value is reached or surpassed.

- Output: Finally, the program prints the value of ans, which represents the minimum number of operations required to reach or exceed the target value n, considering the elements from the input sequence.

- Time Complexity: The time complexity of this algorithm depends on the length of the input sequence v and the value of n. It has a linear time complexity in the worst-case scenario when n is much larger than the sum of elements in v.
